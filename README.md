- history tracking
- support ZOD
- support Ajv (Json schema / Open api)
- UI Builder...

## Known issues (To Be Fixed)

1. when using HTML field, error messages are displayed via `setCustomValidity(error) + reportValidity()` - For the first time form is submitted, all fields going to be touched so error is displayed in random order, on second submit looks like "highest/first invalid" is focused (this is desired) = provide deeper testing and display err "first" element on page

## Run

- `yarn build` for production build
- `yarn dev` for development version - vite react app with examples
- `yarn test` for jest - TODO
